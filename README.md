1. Find team members to groups of 2-3 people. Together, come up with a team name (Team names must be url-safe). We will setup a team on Github and Moodle for you. Kudos for a team name with a corresponding emoji.
2. Make a copy of this repository (using a second remote). Ensure that each member of your team has sufficient access. :star:
